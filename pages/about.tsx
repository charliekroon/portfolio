						In high school I was known as the girl who wrote, and I wanted to stay known for that, preferably for the rest of my life.
						<p>I studied Journalism and Creative Writing. I published my work on various media platforms and outlets, and every now and then I performed my work during literature events. I worked on project basis as a freelance Contentâ€“ and Copy Writer, Journalist, and Social Media Marketeer for a mix of clients (e.g. VPRO, Nu.nl, and PARK Magazine) </p>
						<p>When I was twelve years old, I would work tirelessly on my own Kindertent blog (a Dutch Wordpress for children). In my early twenties I would lose myself trying to edit custom Tumblr Themes with CSS and HTML. With the years my interest in tech grew, and gradually I came to the conclusion that, maybe I didn't want to be the girl who wrote for the rest of my life.</p>
						<p>In 2020 I applied for Codaisseur, a bootcamp of 11 weeks where I learned the basics of coding. Even though I had no idea what I was doing, my passion for creating webapps was reborn.</p>
						<p>I am currently working as a Software Engineer at HackerOne. HackerOne is a bug bounty platform that connects businesses with ethical hackers. Customers include Google, Spotify, TikTok, Goldman Sachs and The U.S. Department of Defense. On a day to day basis, I am mostly working on the Bug Bounty functionality, which is at the core of HackerOne.</p>
