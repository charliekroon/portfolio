This is my personal website! Build from scratch using the powers of NextJS, a little bit of Typescript, React, and Styled Components. 

## The Design
I don't know a lot about design, but I love getting inspired by cool creations on [dribbble](https://dribbble.com/charlita-a-a-a) and awwwards. When creating my own projects, I aim for simplicity, but I'll add some ✨jazz✨ to the design. The ✨jazz✨ of this small project are :hover events, like the sliding of the Menu when hovering, the pulsing of the CV Button and the blur out of the links. Those were just for fun. 

My main focus at work is usually backend stuff, but I wanted to challenge myself by using more CSS. I gave Styled Components a try and I thought it was really cool.

However, I learned a hard lesson while working on this small project. I realized the importance of creating a mobile-first design and a responsive web application *before* developing a desktop-first app. I did it the other way around because I hadn't read enough about responsiveness and mobile-first design, and I really paid for that in the end.

## Things I would do differently
Looking back I wouldn't have made my site with Typescript, simply because it wasn't needed since this was a CSS heavy project. 

## Any future plans?
With the core of the site complete and publicly available, I'm thinking of adding some mouse movements (if I can figure them out) and a dark mode. However, my top priority is to ensure the site is A11y-friendly.
